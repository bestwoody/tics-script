this folder contains all yy and zz files, and they should have the same prefix, like abc.yy abc.zz.
if some yy files share the same zz file, please comment the used zz file in the yy file so that we can reuse them later.

for each generated file from yy and zz, we use gen_fullstack_test_file.sh to generate fullstack test file.
usage:
1. gen_fullstack_test_file.sh tidb_ip tidb_port randgen_file output_file
2. move output_file to integrated/ops/ti.sh.cmds/ci/fullstack_tests/randgen-mpp/
3. ti.sh my.ti ci/fullstack randgen-mpp/output_file false to test whether the output_file runs ok within proper execution time
4. force adding output_file into the repo (git add -f -- output_file) if the output_file has .test suffix

NOTE:
1. we should guarantee the randgen file creates enough valid queries.
2. yy/zz and output_file should have the same prefix name, like abc.yy abc.zz abc_##.test where ## is the query num.
